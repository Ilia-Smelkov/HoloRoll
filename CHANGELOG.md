# Changelog

All notable changes to HoloRoll are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Inno Setup installer (`installer/holoroll.iss`) with REAPER-folder
  auto-detection, headless `/SILENT` support, and custom exit codes for
  unattended invocation.
- `scripts/build_installer.ps1` — local one-shot build of the installer.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — CI that builds the installer and
  publishes a GitHub Release whenever a `v*.*.*` tag is pushed.
- `docs/headless_install.md` — exit-code reference for embedding the
  installer into other tooling.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-26

Initial public release.

### Added
- MDD point-cache loader with Big-Endian binary parser (`MDDDataManager`).
- Companion OBJ loader for triangle topology (`ObjIndexLoader`), with
  vertex-count fallback when basenames don't match.
- Animation library that scans a folder, loads every MDD/OBJ pair,
  and lays out timeline regions per animation (`AnimationLibrary`).
- OpenGL viewport docked into REAPER, rendering Points / Wireframe / Solid
  modes via VBO + `glBufferSubData` per-frame uploads.
- ImGui overlay with library / config / playback / render sections.
- Per-animation pose memory (camera + object rotation + render mode) kept
  in memory for the session.
- Auto-coloured REAPER regions; playback locks to `region.start` so dragging
  a region updates playback immediately.
- Plain-text INI config with `Open config` and `Reload config` actions.
- First-run folder picker, persisted to both config file and REAPER ext-state.

### Removed (relative to MVP prototype)
- `TestMeshProvider` (placeholder mesh used during early development).
- `TimeToFrameMapper` (logic absorbed by `AnimationLibrary::ResolvePlayhead`).
- `ImGuiPanelState` (was an unused wrapper around a hardcoded action ID).
- `ActionBridge` and the F9 / F10 viewport hotkeys.
